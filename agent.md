# Agent policy

This repository is maintained with a simple rule:

- After every code change, I update the documentation to reflect that change.

Scope of “documentation” in this repo typically includes:

- `docs/installation_requirements.md`
- `docs/rtlsdr_fm_radio_gui_low_level_migration.md`

If a change affects UX, settings, dependencies, or runtime behavior, the docs must be updated in the same work session.
